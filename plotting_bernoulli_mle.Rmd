*Plotting the likelihood in R*

Bernoulli MLE
```{r}
#start by creating a function
likelihood = function(n,y,theta){
  return(theta^y*(1-theta)^(n-y))
}
```
This function has three arguments: 
* n: sample size; 
* y: number of deaths; and
* theta: value of the parameter theta

The function returns the computed value according to the Bernoulli pdf.

We proceed to create a sequence of values for theta
```{r}
#create sequence of values for theta
theta = seq(0.01,0.99,0.01)
```

We now plot the likelihood function: 
```{r}
plot(theta, likelihood(400, 72, theta))
abline(v = 0.18)
```

If we look carefully, the likelihood is maximized at the value 72/400 or 0.18.

We can do the same for the log-likelihood function: 
```{r}
#create log-likelihood function
loglike = function(n, y, theta){
  return(y*log(theta)+(n-y)*log(1-theta))
}

#plot log likelihood
plot(theta, loglike(400,72,theta), type = 'l')
abline(v=0.18)
```
